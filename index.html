    You probably haven't seen more ordinary code in your life,
    but idea was to keep it simple both visually and in code, so I can painlessly edit it again
    when I feel like changing job :D

            <p>
                Backend architect with <b>8 years of experience</b> in designing and developing software. I believe
                better
                software is made when developers understand product — that's why I prefer long term contracts. I'm not
                afraid of new challenges, and new technologies. During my career I went through all stages of product
                development, managed projects, designed functionalities, and worked directly with clients. My main stack
                consists of Java 8+, Spring Boot (Web, Security, oAuth2, JPA, Actuator, etc.), Hibernate, RabbitMQ and
                PostgreSQL.

                    <p>
                        Security Point approached me with task to create integration layer between biometric devices,
                        and business software used to manage location. My job was to deliver working solution, and
                        handle communication with South Korea based hardware provider.

                            <li>Implemented role based access control system</li>
                            <li>Analyzed hardware communication protocol, and wrote workarounds for bugs we came upon

                            <li>Implemented server-side face recognition based access control using Neurotechnology

                            <li>Designed process automation: Arming/Disarming alarms, opening vault doors, triggering

                    <span class="big bold">Software Architect @ Essyo</span>
                    <p>
                        I joined Essyo as a software developer, but my skills were quickly recognized. I was put in
                        charge of whole projects. Aside of actual software development my responsibilities were:
                        Technical analysis, milestone planning, tech stack selection,
                        architecture design, and task planning for team members.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What I did</h4>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designed and implemented data warehouse for industry leading loyalty program company.
                                One of requirements was high security of voucher codes. To ensure that vouchers are safe
                                at any time - I used asymmetrical encryption for voucher upload, storage, and
                                communication with other services - like rewards shop.</li>
                            <li>Replaced overcomplicated monolith architecture with simpler, more modern microservices.
                                As a result
                                downtimes are significantly lower, new features are added faster due to suite of Rest
                                APIs that
                                provide data from other systems</li>
                            <li>Migrated financial tool from Java PrimeFaces to Angular - as a result development and
                                maintenance went faster, and more people within company could be tasked with project.
                            </li>
                            <li>Optimized SQL queries in legacy projects. Reduced CPU/IO usage by 60%. As a result there
                                was no longer need to buy
                                new bare-metal server to handle traffic. Company relies on bare-metal in core business,
                                so dynamic scaling was out of option.</li>
                            <li>Designed new reporting tool with dynamic, customizable templates in form of excel
                                workbooks. By result - business can create reports without need to write any new code
                            </li>
                            <li>Implemented virtual payment acceptors to our kiosk software. As a result - kiosk
                                application testing can be done on PC, instead of big, and heavy machine</li>
                            <li>Designed service that provides menu flow to kiosk software. Project managers can now
                                design menu and product structure with handy WYSIWYG web application. As a result -
                                software developers are needed only when custom functionalities has to be implemented
                            </li>
                            <li>Researched, designed and implemented. Loyalty Program on payment terminals. It's goal
                                was to use payment card as loyalty card, and apply discount automatically. Challenge
                                here was
                                complete lack of examples, and documentation on terminal, as well as loyalty program
                                provider.
                                To complete it, I had to do fair bit of reverse engineering of provided APIs.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        In freelance period of my life, I learned self motivation, communication, and foremost -
                        management.
                        On numerous occasions I hired contractors to do things I not excel at. Like mobile development
                        or UX design.
                        This experience taught me, that communication is king, especially when things are not going
                        according to the plan.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What I did</h4>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designed and implemented financial tool, that handles payouts, check printing, and
                                profit tracking for New York based hedge fund. Our immplementation had to replace old,
                                DOS based version. As only reference - I log short handheld video of payout flow.</li>
                            <li>Provided chat software (like WhatsApp) backend for mobile apps. Utilized MQTT for
                                messaging, and Rest API's for less demanding tasks </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>I consider joining ProCreative as one of best decisions in my early carrer. ProCreative taught me
                        responisility for product I worked on, by "If you wrote it, you own it" philosophy.
                        This extended to better quality of code, and better planning. Another note worthy thing were
                        Business Oriented English lessons provided by company. Thanks to them, I grew confidence of my
                        skills,
                        and started to communicate with clients.
